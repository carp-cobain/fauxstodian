# POC: fauxstodian

A fake Solana custodian with vault program.

## Status

Incomplete - this is a work in progress; none of the functionality has been tested.

## References

The architecture used in this project is based loosely on the article
[here](https://kerkour.com/rust-web-application-clean-architecture),
but the presentation layer is gRPC instead of http/json.
